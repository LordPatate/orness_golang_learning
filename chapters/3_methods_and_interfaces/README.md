## Exercise: Mortals and DeathListeners

Create the Notary and Aristocrat structs and define their methods so that the tests passes.
They will have to implement the interfaces from [death_listener.go](death_listener.go).
The Notary listens for a Aristocrat's death and proceeds to share its legacy among its heirs.
An Aristocrats that fell in love listens to its soulmate's death and kills itself, Romeo and Juliet style.
